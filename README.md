## Project Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze and visualize a dataset of over 22,000 rows of HR data spanning from the year 2000 to 2020. The goal is to gain insights into the company's workforce demographics, distribution, and turnover trends. The insights derived from this analysis can help the company make informed decisions about workforce management and planning.

## Data Description
The dataset contains HR data of a company with over 22,000 rows spanning two decades (2000-2020). The data includes various attributes of employees such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, location (headquarters or remote), job titles, department, hire and term dates, and tenure.

## Tools
### Python: 
Python was used for importing the data CSV file into the database.

### MySQL: 
MySQL Workbench was used for data cleaning and writing queries to answer the questions posed in the project.

### PowerBI: 
PowerBI was used to build a static data visualization dashboard for the report, presenting the results in an easy-to-understand format.

## Questions
The project sought to answer the following questions:

1. What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
4. How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
5. What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments and job titles?
7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?
9. What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?

## Results and Findings
The analysis yielded several key findings:

- There are more male employees in the company.
- The White race is the most dominant, while Native Hawaiian and American Indian are the least dominant.
- The age distribution of employees is skewed towards the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups.
- A significant number of employees work at the headquarters compared to remote locations.
- The average length of employment for terminated employees is around 8 years.
- The gender distribution across departments is fairly balanced, but there are generally more male than female employees.
- The Marketing department has the highest turnover rate.
- A large number of employees come from the state of Ohio.
- The net change in employees has increased over the years.
- The average tenure for each department is about 8 years.

## Future Work
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's workforce. However, future work could delve deeper into understanding the factors contributing to the high turnover rate in certain departments. Additionally, predictive analytics could be employed to forecast hiring needs and turnover trends.
